# Tech Challenge for MURAL
I have implemented the Checkout page using HTML and CSS. I am including the compiled 
.css file so that you don't have to compile it. You can check the styles.scss included in the css 
folder.
When implementing, my priority was pixel perfection. After making the page look as the design, 
I checked the code to improve the performance. So I checked any repeated code or 
overqualifying selectors on the .scss file. There are still some tags as key selectors, wich
I realise is not the most efficient practice, the best way would be to use classes as key selectors. 
I decided to leave it like this since it's not a large site, so I prefer in this case to keep
the html clean.
After implementing the desktop version, I added media queries to implement it for tablets and
phones.
Finally, I introduced a script at the end of the .html file to make the slider work. I used jQuery
library to achieve this.
